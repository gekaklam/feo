Feo: Tape Library Simulator
===========================

Feo, as a reference to iron oxide (here Fe2O3) which is commonly used in magnetic tape media, allows to simulate automated tape library systems integrated into the storage hierarchy of modern data centers.

The system is modularized to reflect the various physical and software based components found in actual storage systems for two reasons: 1) to accurately resemble the paths data flows in actual systems 2) to resemble a software development process as it would be used for software that operates and manages actual enterprise tape systems.
